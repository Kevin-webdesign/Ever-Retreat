                            dream of blending design, hospitality, and community empowerment. Growing up in a family of
                            engineers, Theophile was influenced by both the world of design and the beauty of Rwanda's
                            tourism potential. Although he pursued engineering, his dream to integrate tourism with his
                            skills never faded.</p>

                        <p>In 2024, he launched Ever Retreat, with a mission to create eco-friendly, luxurious
                            hospitality spaces in Rwanda's most iconic destinations. This project combines cutting-edge
                            engineering and a deep commitment to community development, creating a legacy of sustainable
                            tourism.</p>
